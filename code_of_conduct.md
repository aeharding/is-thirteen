# Code Of Conduct and Kindness

The maintainers of this software project stand for equality, especially when
comparing against the number twelve.

The *is-twelve* project is dedicated to providing a
comparison-against-thirteen-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
sexual orientation, typeclass, document encoding, or klout score.

The pull requests will continue until comparison against twelve improves.

Make twelve great again, or I will crush you.
